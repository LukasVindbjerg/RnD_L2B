# RnD_L2B
Exploring the integration of Large Language Models (LLM) with Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) to interpret and generate dynamic behaviors based on textual inputs. This project combines foundational concepts in natural language processing and machine learning to address ambiguities in command interpretation
# RnD_L2B - Research and Development: LLM to Behaviour

## Overview

RnD_L2B is a research project that investigates the use of Large Language Models (LLM), like BERT, integrated with Domain-Specific Languages (DSL) to understand and generate dynamic behaviors from textual data. This project focuses on bridging gaps in natural language understanding by tackling ambiguities in command interpretation and behavior generation, aiming to enhance the interaction between humans and AI-driven systems.
